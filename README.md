# Cities Skylines 2 : Unemployment Monitor Mod
Unemployment Monitor is a plugin for HookUI that displays various, detailed employment statistics about your cities.  Currently the mod displays unemployment rates by education level, the number of homeless households, and the number of underemployed Cims.  Underemployed Cims are citizens who accepted jobs below their education level.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cities Skylines 2 modding is in a volatile state right now since Colossal Order has not yet released official modding tools.  Download and install mods at your own risk, and only download mods from their official sources (GitHub, Thunderstore).  Many websites steal mods from official sources, manipulate them to add malware, and upload them to unofficial websites.  This mod and all others that I develop will ONLY be available here on GitHub or Thunderstore and should be considered the only official sources.

> [!CAUTION]
> This update will make small changes to your game's save files.  I have tested the mod to ensure that this will not corrupt your files, and you should be able to uninstall the mod at any time and continue playing.  However, you should DEFINITELY back up your save files before installing this mod just in case.
