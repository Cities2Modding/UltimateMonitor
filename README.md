> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cities Skylines 2 modding is in a volatile state right now since Colossal Order has not yet released official modding tools.  Download and install mods at your own risk, and only download mods from their official sources (GitHub, Thunderstore).  Many websites steal mods from official sources, manipulate them to add malware, and upload them to unofficial websites.  This mod and all others that I develop will ONLY be available here on GitHub or Thunderstore and should be considered the only official sources.
